# Bull Email Sending Simulation

This is a simple project that utilizes Bull in Node.js to simulate an email sending task. By offloading the task to a Bull task, the main application program remains unaffected and doesn't slow down.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

3. Configure the email settings:

```
